playing around with coding, github and morse code - all at the same time!

I was re-reading the short story Terminus from Tales of Pirx the Piot by Stanislaw Lem, which (apart from being an affecting story)
contains quite a lot of morse code. I've never had any reason to learn morse, but I was looking for little coding projects and 
challenges to set myself and something to learn morse with seemed suitably do-able.

So I've started with a bash script that uses the beep program and have got it up to a reasonable level of functionality over the past
couple of days. 

I was doing a bit at home and a bit at work and storing my scripts in dropbox and whatnot, and I thought Hey, isn't this what 
github's for? sort of? And if I'm using this exercise to learn bash and morse and vim, well, why not github too?

So I've stuck it on here. Or I will have when I figure out what the HELL is going on. 

I've gone with bash because it's the most basic thing I can achieve what I wanted to achieve with. If I continue to work of this I 
guess I'll try moving to python and/or other languages, adding a gui etc. 

I dunno.
